## Description
I can remember the days as a child when I was bored in the beginning of a project. I was always playing with my mouse on the monitor instead of the things I was supposed to do, that is why I decided to make this application to motivate children by make it easier and more fun for them to pick a subject for their project.

## What API did I use
I made use of the OBA Api, you can make 200 request an hour before you have to change the URL of the website to make it work again.  

Example of a record:
Insert record here 

## How to use
Clone or download the repository $ git clone https://github.com/TimTerwijn/web-app-from-scratch-1920.git  
Put code on a server.  
Go to index.html in your browser.  
Use the arrow buttons to move Marco. 
Press the up arrow to pick a subject, like animals. . 
Then you will see animals instead of subject.
Use the arrow buttons again to pick an animal, like dog.
Then you will see books of dogs instead of animals.
Use the arrow buttons again to pick a book.
Then you will see the info of the book instead of the books.
